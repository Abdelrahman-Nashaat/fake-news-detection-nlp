# Fake News Detection using NLP

This project showcases a practical implementation of fake news detection using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

## File Included
- `FakeNews_NLP.ipynb`: Contains the full code for text preprocessing, POS tagging, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and data visualization.

## Key Techniques Used
- Text cleaning and normalization
- POS Tagging using spaCy
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Sentiment analysis using TextBlob
- Word cloud generation and data visualization

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- spaCy
- TextBlob
- NLTK
- pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

## How to Run
1. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
